#How the Program Works

##1\. Prepare the URLs

The crawler first goes to /gallery/ and its previous pages like /gallery/page/2, 3, 4...up to 10. So 10 directory pages in total.

Then it will extract the URLs of the inner pages, and store the URLs in memory.

##\. Get the Images and Site Info

Then, the crawler will create a folder for the website, which contains the screenshot image, and a txt file that contains the site's title and url.
